abstract = "Intercalation synthesis of graphene-capped cobalt silicides has been studied in situ by core-level photoelectron spectroscopy with synchrotron radiation and low-energy electron diffraction. It is found that at 400 °C the intercalation of graphene/Ni(1 1 1) with cobalt takes place in a wide range of coverage up to 17 ML Co. Graphene is strongly coupled with the upper layer of Co atoms and stabilizes the fcc structure of the intercalated Co(1 1 1) film. Subsequent intercalation of graphene/Co/Ni(1 1 1) with silicon results in the formation of an ordered Co3Si surface phase of the (√3 × √3)R30° structure and then of Co2Si silicide and Co-Si solid solution. Our experimental data and DFT calculations have shown that the coupling between the graphene layer and the surface silicide is rather weak and the properties of quasi-freestanding graphene are preserved."

abstract = "Graphene grown epitaxially on SiC(0001) substrates always exhibits n-type doping due to the coupling interaction between the substrate and graphene. The electronic properties of epitaxial graphene are thus impaired relative to those of free-standing graphene, limiting its potential in device applications. In this work, by using first-principles calculations, we show that charge neutrality can be achieved by growing an FeSi intercalation layer between the SiC substrate and the buffer carbon layer. The formation of an atomic Si layer between FeSi and the buffer carbon layer prevents electron transfer to the subsequent graphene layer. The subsequently grown graphene therefore displays the electronic characteristics of quasi-free-standing graphene with charge neutrality. The calculated surface energy of the FeSi-intercalated structure shows considerable stability compared to elemental Fe- and H-intercalated structures over a wide range of temperature and pressure. This will promote the practical application of FeSi-intercalated epitaxial graphene on SiC(0001) at high temperature as a core element of microelectronic devices."}

abstract  ="Intercalation of magnetic iron atoms through graphene formed on the SiC(0001) surface is found to induce significant changes in the electronic properties of graphene due mainly to the Fe-induced asymmetries in charge as well as spin distribution. From our synchrotron-based photoelectron spectroscopy data together with ab initio calculations{,} we observe that the Fe-induced charge asymmetry results in the formation of a quasi-free-standing bilayer graphene while the spin asymmetry drives multiple spin-split bands. We find that Fe adatoms are best intercalated upon annealing at 600 °C{,} exhibiting split linear π-bands{,} characteristic of a bilayer graphene{,} but much diffused. Subsequent changes in the C 1s{,} Si 2p{,} and Fe 3p core levels are consistently described in terms of Fe-intercalation. Our calculations together with a spin-dependent tight binding model ascribe the diffuse nature of the π-bands to the multiple spin-split bands originated from the spin-injected carbon atoms residing only in the lower graphene layer."}
